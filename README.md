# MacDevSetup
This script sets up MacOS for development.

## TODO
You will need to replace the following placeholders with your own information:
- `TODO:Your Full Name` - Your actual name for Git configuration
- `TODO:Your-Email@example.com` - Your email address for Git and SSH key
- Repository URLs in the `repos` array - Replace with your actual repositories (and custom names if needed)
- Uncomment and customize the git URL override if using a custom Git hosting service

You can also customize the `dev_tools` and `dev_apps` arrays by adding or removing tools and applications based on your needs.
