# MacDevSetup
This script sets up MacOS for development.

## TODO
Search for "TODO" in the code to find all placeholders that need to be replaced with your information:
- `TODO:Your Full Name` - Your actual name for Git configuration
- `TODO:Your-Email@example.com` - Your email address for Git and SSH key
- Repository URLs in the `repos` array - Replace with your actual repositories (and custom names if needed)
- Uncomment and customize the git URL override if using a custom Git hosting service

You can also customize the `dev_tools` and `dev_apps` arrays by adding or removing tools and applications based on your needs. You can search for available packages at [brew.sh](https://brew.sh/).
